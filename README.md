# insight

As an Insight Data Science Fellow, I worked on a consulting project for an online company that assists their users in solving complex financial questions using tutorials, tools, and calculators. This financial company had recently partnered with a loan company, and was advertising for them on their site. In order to increase ROI for their advertising partners, the finance company must drive interested users to sign up for a specific product (in this case, a loan). Therefore, my task was to determine which factors best predict whether a user will click on a loan web advertisement and submit their contact information (i.e., lead converters), versus those who will not (i.e., non-converters). The company will use these insights, provided in a written report, to specifically target users who are more likely to convert, thereby increasing the number of converters and ROI for their advertising partner.
